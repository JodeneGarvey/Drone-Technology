			<u><header>WHAT ARE DRONES</header></u>
			<p>
			Drones also known as Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs)  are aircrafts that are either controlled by ‘pilots’ from the ground or increasingly, autonomously following a pre-programmed mission.

			<h3>The Transmitter(TX)</h3>
				<p>
				Enables the user to control the aircraft from a distance, using 2.4 gigahertz spread spectrum radio signals. 
				</p>
				
			<h3>The Receiver(RX)</h3>
				<p>
				Receivers are electric devices with built in antennas that intercept the radio signals from the transmitters, and convert them into alternating current pulses. 
				The receiver then produces information and sends it t to the Flight Control Board. 
				</p>
				
			<h3>Flight Control Board</h3>
				<p>
				After the transmitter is switched on, and the main power source is plugged in, the receiver starts communicating with the transmitter. From this moment, the receiver will send every signal to the onboard computer.
				The sensors on the computer will make sure the aircraft is stable, even under windy conditions, which makes controlling the aircraft easier.
				As the transmitter sends signals to the aircraft, the onboard computer sends signals to the electric speed controllers. The electric controllers can control the amount of voltage received by the motors, in order to control the speed of each propeller. 
				This system allows the drone to maneuver.
				</p>
			
			<h3>The Battery (lithium polymer battery)</h3>
				<p>
				The Lithium polymer battery is rechargeable and lightweight, capable of delivering high discharge rates to provide enough power to the brushless electric motors. 
				</p>
				
			<h3>Electronic Speed Controller</h3>
				<p>
				The electronic speed controller is connected to the battery and controls the rotational speed of the motor by adjusting electric current to ensure the motors are running smoothly and efficiently.
				The controller has a built in governor, which keeps the motor’s RPM (rotation per minute) at a steady level, in every flight condition.
				</p>
				
			<h3>The Electric Motor</h3>
				<p>
				On the outside of the motor, there are magnets attached to the inner wall, called the rotor.
				There are also permanent magnets on the inside of the motor, called the stator.
				As the electricity runs through these magnets, it creates an electromagnetic field that attracts and repels the magnets in the stator.
				The constant change of polarity keeps the motor spinning.
				</p>
				
			<h3>The Propeller</h3>
				<p>
				The propeller converts the motion into lifting power. 
				Because of the special shape of the blades, the air pressure is uneven on two sides while they are in motion.
				</p>
			
			<h3>The Control Surface</h3>
				<p>
				The flight computer can individually control the speed of each motor. 
				The propellers can create an even lifting power in the four points of the model, making it lean towards a specific direction. 
				For example, if the two propellers on the right side drop RPM (rotation per minute), the lifting power will be bigger on the left side, therefore the right side will start descending in a quick motion and the model will start drifting to the right.
				The onboard computer will increase RPM when the drifting speed reaches the limit, and position the model back into a stable hovering position even if the user takes his hand off the controls.
