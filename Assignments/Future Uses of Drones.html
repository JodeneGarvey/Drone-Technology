			<h1 style="text-align:center">Drone Technology in the Future</h1>
				<p>
				Drones can be low flying, high flying, tiny or huge, silent or noisy, super-visible or totally invisible. Lights, sound, cameras, microphones, sensors, robotic arms, wave cancellation technology, or wave enhancement technology can be added depending on the purpose of the drone.
				Simply adding a robotic display will enable us to fly in and have a private video conversation with someone on the other side of the world. 
				Flying drones can also roll along the ground, stick to the side of a building, float in a river, dive under water, and jump onto a building, climb a tree, or attach themselves like parasites to the sides of trains, ships, and airplanes. 
				One moment they can be hovering in front of you and the next they can fly off at the speed of sound, disappearing into the clouds. 
				Combining all these capabilities, attributes, and special features into one single device will open up a world of possibilities unlike anything before in all history.

			<h2><u><i>Future Uses of Drones</i></u></h2>
			
			<li><b>Personal Transport</b></li>
			
				<p>
				In 2016, Ehang revealed the 184, a personal transport drone that looks like something out of Star Wars. 
				If it seems like nothing more than a giant drone, that’s because it is. The only difference is that there’s a small space inside designed for a single passenger.
				The idea is pretty simple. You order your 184, tell it where you want to go and allow the autonomous flight pilot to whisk you away to your chosen destination. 
				Ehang has been testing the 184 already in Nevada, but we don’t know how soon it’ll be available. But how realistic is it to imagine a world in which personal transport drones are the norm? 
				Well, with other tech giants such as Uber also investing heavily in aerial transport, it’s a matter of when, not if.

			<li><b>Fireworks</b></li>
			<p>
			Drones are increasingly being used for the purpose of entertainment.
			Recently a swarm of Parrot drones taking part in a UK talent competition as part of a dance act. 
			The most obvious use for swarms is for light displays – technology’s answer to fireworks two companies pioneering in this space are Intel and Spaxels. 
			Spaxels, from Austrian tech company Ars Electronica, are drones fitted with tiny LEDs. 
			Intel programs them to perform synchronized performances and autonomous light shows. 
			These can be used for marketing and promotional displays or just straight up entertainment.
			Sure, they don’t have that wonderful post-firework smokey haze, but they are still pretty impressive. 
			Intel recently broke the world record for the number of autonomous drones synchronized at once, with a whopping 500.

			<li><b>Firefighting</b></li>
			
			<p>
			Drones can actually be used for good in the incident of a fire. 
			There are two drones that could have a revolutionary impact on the way emergency services deal with fires in the future. 
			First of all there is the FAROS, which stands for Fireproof Aerial Robot System. 
			FAROS is under development at the Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Korea. 
			This is a clever drone that’s been designed to autonomously steer through a blaze, searching for people who may have been caught up inside of buildings too dangerous to send fire crews into.
			As well as streaming back a live video feed, FAROS can literally climb along walls and is completely fireproof. 
			Second, is a drone that’s been designed to stop wildfires in their tracks instead of emergency services. 
			This is a drone under development at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
			It carries several small spheres full of an extremely flammable chemical powder, which are released and set off as the drone flies along a designated route. 
			The result is a controlled burn that stops wildfires from spreading.
