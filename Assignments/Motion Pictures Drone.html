			<h1 style="text-align:center;">Drones and Motion Pictures</h1> 
				<p>
				Film and television industry embraces new advances in technology both in how they tell stories and how they reach audiences. 
				Since the inception of the first motion picture more than a century ago, film and television has been at the cutting-edge of entertainment and technology. 
				From 4D theaters and immersive movie-going experiences to special effects and shooting at 48 frames-per-second, innovations in filmmaking transport audiences to new worlds.

				<h2>Drones Used in Movie and Television Production</h2>
				<img src="Drone Images/D38.jpg" align="right" width="500"/>
					<p>
					As equipment has gotten smaller, lighter and more complicated, aerial filming no longer has to involve expensive helicopters and static cranes.
					Production companies are gradually using drones to nail those shots that require dramatic panoramas, adrenalin-filled action sequences, 360-degree views of subjects or literal birds’ eye views. 
					No other filming method can start a sequence inside a building and end up at 400 feet altitude in one uncut shot, except for the drone.
					</p>
					<p>
					Drones allow the reader to build a better mental picture of the layout of the land.
					Unlike bulky helicopters, the drones can get down to ground level, with smaller shadows and less air disturbance. 
					These were qualities that were particularly useful when filming scenes in many motion pictures. Drones small size means they’ll do indoor shots too. Of course, using drones is not without complications. 
					Companies need authorization from the Civil Aviation Authority to work with them and they can be risky if not manned by properly trained pilots. 
					</p>
					<p>
					In the right hands, they can make sitting on your coach feel like you’re soaring over the Amazon, or Arctic or African plain. 
					In my opinion, is a very exciting prospect.
					</p>

					<h2>Drones and Ducumentary Films</h2>

						<p>
						Drones have played an increasingly large role in wildlife preservation and filmmaking in recent years. 
						In 2011, a team of filmmakers used a drone  to document a pride of lions for a feature story in this month's issue of National Geographic. 
						The idea, according to the magazine, was to provide a more intimate glimpse into the daily lives of one of the world’s most fearsome predators and to photograph them like never before.
						</p>
						<p>
						Unfortunately, animals hate to be photographed as it is demeaning to them and capturing the lions from an up-close, ground level posed obvious risks, both to the safety of the film making team and the welfare of the pride they were following. 
						They could have easily photographed the lions from afar with standard telephoto lenses, but National Geographic had a more innovative solution in mind one that involved aerial drones, robots, and infrared lights to capture scenes of the Serengeti for a TV documentary in Japan. 
						Researchers in Kenya, meanwhile, have begun using unmanned aerial drones to monitor areas susceptible to rhino poaching.
						</p>
						<p>
						Drone technology provided an opportunity to photograph animals on their terms, though it's uncertain whether similar devices could be used to capture elephants, zebras, or other species. 
						Lions are both confident and conservative in how they expend their energy, although they were aware that the machines belonged to the green truck that had been following them, they never perceived the robot as a threat.

						<h2>Aerial Cineamatogrophy and Drones</h2>

							<p>
							The emergence of drones has raised the expectation for cinematic quality and visual storytelling for filmmakers. 
							Drone footage; establish shots, immediately making it a useful tool when shooting scenes once the same technique that are incorporated by cinematographers are used. 
							Making not only far away aerial shots possible but live action sequence shots. Filmmaking can be an expenses process. 
							Not only can drones eliminate other expensive tools such as cranes, jibs, and tracks, but they can make it much easier to capture some shots as they don’t take up the same amount of space as some more traditional tools. 
							Avoiding traditional cranes and jibs may also save on set up time. 
							</p>

						<h2>Positives of Utalizing Drones in Motion Pictures</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Motion Picture Images</li>
								<p>
								Stunning aerial shots are now posible without using studio-based equipment.
								Drones are also light weight making it easier to access the drones compared to other heavy equipment traditionally used.
								</p>
								<li>Cost Effective and Environmentally Friendly</li>
								<p>
								Unlike aircraft, drones don’t burn liters of avgas per hour and pollute the environment
								The Filmmaker can wait for the perfect shot for a long time without worrying about the cost of fuel and its impact on the environment.
								</p>
							</ul>
						<h2>Negatives of Utalizing Drones in Motion Pictures</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Battery Life</li>
								<p>
								Undeniably drones can help you get some amazing photos, but you have very limited time for them to function. 
								Even a fully-charged drone can fly just for seven minutes. 
								If filmmakers are to cover an event and wants aerial photography, it is better to hire professionals for aircraft photography.
								</p>
								<li>Legal Issues</li>
								<p>
								Not everyone is allowed to use drones for photography.
								Whether you want to use it for professional photography or for private use, legal permission is needed.
								</p>
