				<h1 style="text-align:center;">Uses of Drones in the Commercial Industry</h1>
				<h2>Hurricane Hunting</h2>
				<p>
					Drones can charge into the heart of a storm without risking human life and limb.
					That's one reason NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Northrop Grumman teamed up on a three-year, $30-million experiment to use long-range Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to spy on storms as they evolve.
				</p>
				<img src="Drone Images/D15.jpg" align="left"/>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
					In a world that has witnessed many destructive and disastrous storms and hurricanes, the need to better track these extreme weather events have become pertinent.
					Storm hunting simply connotes gathering knowledge about the processes occurring inside storms and how these processes affect storm formation and intensification. 
					This has enabled scientists to forecast the tracks of storms and hurricanes and predict more accurately the intensity of future storms. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
					Storm hunting has witnessed many advancements in the last several decades. 
					Originally, scientists used hurricane-hunting planes to send dropsondes (which are instruments that float down with a parachute) to gather data on a storm. 
					These traditional instruments were unable to fly above 5,000 feet due to their inability to weather through extreme turbulence. 
					A storm's intensity is driven by multiple factors, which made storm hunting difficult with the traditional instruments. 
					These factors range from large-scale elements, such as winds that steer the storms, to smaller-scale ones that include how individual clouds organize themselves into bigger cloud systems. 
					The latter was difficult to observe in space and time, in part because it occurs across only a few hundred kilometers. 
					In recent years, researchers have been able to develop hurricane-proof data-gathering drones that can fly above 5,000 feet. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
					On September 10, 2013, NASA scientists made a landmark in the world of unmanned aircraft systems.
					They successfully studied the storm using a drone that was able to fly above the swirling mass of clouds to examine how storm forms and grows.
					The drone which was in the form of an airplane was dubbed Global Hawk . 
					The Global Hawk was designed such that it enables scientists witness the life cycles of tropical storms and hurricanes by helping researchers in studying them. 
					These observations help scientists in developing more accurate models projecting the path of storms and determining whether or not they will gather strengths. 
					The NASA's Global Hawk drones have relatively small bodies, with a wingspan that stretches 35 meters.
					The all-white flying machines are able to perform long flights for an average of 18-24 hours over altitudes as high as 60,000 feet. 
					The Global hawk uses a variety of equipment including dopsondes, which measure temperature, moisture, and wind speed when dropped from the flying robot. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
					Similarly, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) successfully launched its unmanned aerial vehicle into Hurricane Edouard from one of its hurricane-hunter aircraft. 
					The flying robot, named Coyote is a winged, 7-pound drone.
					It is designed such that when dropped from a plane, can descend slowly all the way through the core of a storm. 
					It is able to fly for two hours on its own.
					The flying machine uses GPS device to transmit data, used by scientists to understand how storm intensifies and to accurately predict the impact of a storm. 
					Its relative lightweight design enables it to fly with the wind directed up, down and sideways to currents.
					This makes it possible for the drone to measure the storm's inner core and storm activity at the lowest altitudes. 
					The invention of these advanced drones have helped officials in preparing adequately for possible hurricanes. 
					Thus, reducing potential disasters from these extreme weather events.

				<h2>Environmental Monitoring and Conservation</h2>
				<p>
					Tropical deforestation continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. 
					Remote sensing technology is increasingly used to assess changes in forest cover, species distributions and carbon stocks. 
					However, satellite and airborne sensors can be prohibitively costly and inaccessible for researchers in developing countries.
					Therefore, environmental due diligence is a vital factor where potential environmental risks are a concern. 
					Drone technology suits a myriad of conservation and environmental protection applications, offering a quick, easy and cost-effective aerial imagery on demand. 
					From glacial feature modeling and erosion monitoring to animal counting and species identification, the list of projects that drones are being used for is long and continues to grow over time.

				<p style="text-align:left;">
					There are many reasons why professionals such as environmental engineers and scientific researchers are increasingly using drones, often in place of terrestrial surveying equipment or traditional aerial imaging services.
					The benefits these professionals often mention include:
					
					<h3>Flexibility</h3>
						<p>
						Drones can be launched on demand without needing to source and acquire manned aircraft services or commission and wait for satellite imagery.
						</p>
					<h3>Timely</h3>
						<p>
						A Drone produces completely up-to-date imagery. 
						This makes drones suited to time-sensitive projects and for monitoring locations at regular intervals (i.e. using the same flight plan each time). 
						</p>
					<h3>Efficient</h3>
						<p>
						Unlike traditional surveying techniques, using drones are fast and requires minimal staff, plus using an aerial approach overcomes common site access issues such as impenetrable vegetation, boulders, crevasses etc. 
						</p>
					<h3>Cost Effective</h3>
						<p>
						Used regularly, the cost of a professional drone system is typically lower than third-party alternatives such as manned imaging aircraft. 
						A drone system often provides a complete return on investment in as little as a few months or a few large projects compared to the alternatives.
						</p>
						<h3>Discreate</h3>
						<p>
						Drones are small and light electric-powered, especially fixed-wing aircraft, make little noise and are often bird-shaped, meaning animals on the ground are rarely disturbed by these tools, if they notice them at all. 
						</p>
				</p>
				<img src="Drone Images/D21.jpg" width="1247",height="100"/>
				<p>The camera, or payload, that a drone carries directly influences the imagery it can capture and therefore its potential usage. These include:</p>
				<h4>RGB Cameras (left image above)</h4>
				<p>
				Drones contain RGB sensors which acquire data in the visible spectrum (specifically Red, Green & Blue bands). 
				The images they produce can be transformed into 2D orthomosaics and 3D digital surface models.
				Such sensors have been used, for example to create terrain models of glacial features, monitor coastal erosion, perform volume measurements etc. 
				</p>
				<h4>Near-infrared (NIR), red-edge (RED) & multispectral cameras (center image above)</h4>
				<p>
				These cameras acquire data across bands in the visible and non-visible spectrums.
				This type of data enables users to compute vegetation indices in order to create reflectance maps for assessing plant health, estimating biomass and more. 
				</p>
				<h4>Thermal Cameras (right image above)</h4>
				<p>
				Temperature-measuring thermal cameras assign a temperature value to each pixel and have already proved highly useful in the field—being used to count treetop orangutan nests and seals, assess the spread of wildfires and more.
				</p>

				<h2>Drone Delivery Service</h2>
				
				<img src="Drone Images/D2.jpg"/>
					<p style="text-align:left">
					Due to the innovation of drone technology it has been quite apparent that due to their size, shape and capabilities, drones can be utilized in the commercial drone industry for delivery purposes.
					Since global companies like Amazon, Google, Walmart and DHL taking the step into its own drone delivery program. 
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:left">
					According to The Walker Sands Future of Retail 2016 Study, customers being fully on board with drone delivery, as  79% of US consumers said they would be “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to request drone delivery if their package could be delivered within an hour 
					and 73% of respondents said that they would pay up to $10 for a drone delivery.
					</p>
