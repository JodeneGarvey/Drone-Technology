			<h1 style="text-align:center">Drones and the Agricultural Industry</h1>
				<p>
				Drone technology has been widely expanding in multiple industries. 
				Today, however, practical applications for drones are expanding faster than ever in a variety of industries, thanks to robust investments and the relaxing of some regulations governing their use. 
				Allowing the most promising areas being in agriculture. 
				Due to drones being able to address the most severe challenges such as the rise in population and change in weather patterns.
				Drone technology will give the agriculture industry a high-technology makeover, with planning and strategy based on real-time data gathering and processing all throughout the year. 
				</p>
				
				<h2><u><b>Soil and Field Analysis Using Drones</b></u></h2>
				
				<p style="text-align:left">
				Drone technology can be instrumental for the begining of the crop cycle.
				They are able to produce high quality,pricise 3D maping in order to analyse properties such as soil pH, salinity, and texture.
				Making it more effecient for farmers to identify the type of crop that would be best suited based on the soil analysis.
				</p>

				<h2><u><b>Crop Planting Using Drones</b></u></h2>
				<p>
				Drone planting systems is a new innovation in the agriculture industry.
				This system allow the drones to shoot specialised seed and nutrient filled pods into the soil below providing the plant with all the nutrients it needs, drastically decreasing the planting cost.
				</p>

				<h2><u><b>Crop Spraying Using Drones</b></u></h2>
				<p>
				Crop Spraying drones are more effective as they can simply take off and land safely. 
				Flying at low altitude of several meters, the crop-spraying Drone can be controlled in any distance. 
				They are suitable for all kinds of complex terrain, crops and plantations of varying heights. 
				Precise and accurate crop spraying ensures the best treatment and use of fertilizers or pesticides on lands. 
				Drones using Agricultural Sprays are designed to be more reliable as the technology results in low and ultra-low volume spraying which is a viable alternative in todayâ€™s environmentally aware world. 
				The benefits of crop spraying with a drone technology include a significant reduction in application cost, improvement in coverage and fewer chemicals used.

				<h2>Positives of Utalizing Drones in the Agriculture Industry</h2>
					<li><b>Analysis</b></li>
						<p>
						Drones might be used for soil and field analysis. 
						They can be used to produce precise 3-D maps that can be used to carry out soil analysis on soil property, moisture content, and soil erosion. 
						This is very significant in planning seed planting patterns. 
						Even after planting, such information is valuable for both irrigation and the management of the nitrogen level in the soil.
						</p>
					
					<li><b>Monitoring</b></li>
						<p>
						The largest obstacle in farming is ineffective crop monitoring of vast fields.
						This challenge is made worse by the rise of unpredictable weather patterns which lead to increased risks and maintenance costs. 
						Drones can be used to develop time series animations to show exact crop development which reveals production inefficiencies hence better crop management.
						</p>
					
					<li><b>Health Assessment</b></li>
						<p>
						Some drones are capable of scanning crops using visible and near infrared light. 
						On-board light processing devices are then capable to recognize the amounts of green and near-infrared light reflected by the plants. 
						This data is then used to develop multi-spectral images which illustrate the plant health. 
						These images can be used to track crop health and to monitor remedied administered if any sickness is discovered.
						</p>
						
					<h2>Negatives of Utalizing Drones in the Agriculture Industry</h2>
						<li><b>Flight Time and Flight Range</b></li>
							<p>
							There are some problems with drones in agriculture. 
							Most of the drones have a short flight time of between 20 minutes to an hour. 
							This limits the acres that it can cover for every charge. 
							The flight range also limits the radius that can be cover during every flight time.
							Drones that can offer longer flight time and longer range are relatively costlier.
							</p>
							
						<li><b>Weather Dependent</b></li>
							<p>
							Drones are much more prone to climatic conditions, unlike traditional aircraft. 
							If it is very windy or rainy outside you may not be able to fly them.
							</p>
							
						<li><b>Initial Cost of Purchase</b></li>
							<p>
							Drones with the features that qualify them for use in the agricultural are quite costly. 
							This is mostly so for fixed wing drones. For some drones, the heavy cost is inclusive of hardware, software, tools and imaging sensors.
							Buying drone that does not come equipped with the necessary equipment could be cheaper. 
							However, the desired cameras and the processing software are quite costly making it equally capital intensive. 
							Purchasing drones equipped for use in agriculture could prove costly in the short run but valuable in the long run.
