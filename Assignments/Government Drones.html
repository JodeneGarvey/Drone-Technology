					<h2 style="text-align:center;">WAYS GOVERNMENT IS USING DRONE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
						<p>Drones are easy to acquire and operate, making them an asset to enemies as they invent new and creative ways to penetrate highly secure environments. Mobility and low visibility make drones useful tools in missions against government interests.  They can be used for physical harm, harassment, or espionage, posing danger to classified intelligence and research, security and defense, elite technologies, physical premises, and personnel safety. Drones specialized technology is used by law enforcement, homeland security, military, and government facilities to reinforce their defense against hostile intentions.</p>
					
			
			<h4 style="text-align:left;">How Drones Serve Government Industries</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Detects and identifies intruding drones using a multi-sensor technology.
					<li>Provides real-time monitoring and instant alerts.</li>
					<li>Easily integrates into existing security operations.</li>
					<li>Helps safeguard public safety, sensitive information, physical facilities, critical technologies, and weapons and artillery.</li>
					<li>Retains alert data for use as digital evidence in legal proceedings.</li></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h1> Drones and Law Enforcement</h1>
				<img src="Drone Images/D9.jpg"  width="330" align="right"/>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Drones in law enforcement have been used for surveillance to support missions related to kidnappings, search and rescue operations, drug interdictions, and fugitive investigations.</p>
				<p>
					Drones armed with cameras and sensor payloads have been used by military and border control agencies for decades to improve situational awareness. 
					Commercialization now has brought more UAVs, or unmanned aerial vehicles, to market—making such eyes-in-the-sky an invaluable tool for law enforcement.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> As a society, we generally want our cops to have all of the tools they need to keep the bad guys at bay. We just want them to use those tools responsibly and without sticking their beaks into ordinary, generally law-abiding citizens' everyday life. Whether it's using infrared heat sensors to detect marijuana grow houses, global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices to tail suspects or breathalyzers to calculate how much a driver has had to drink, advances in technology usually mean new ways to make cops more effective. </p>
				
				<h1> Drones and Medical Aid</h1>
				<img src="Drone Images/D10.jpg" width="280" height="220" align="left"/>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
					Drones or UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are increasingly coming to the forefront of humanitarian technology innovation.
					While drones are not new to headlines, their application in disaster relief situations is still in the embryonic stage, with exciting developments coming fast.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
					Innovators want to use drones to deliver vital emergency supplies to areas with no road access, as well as to operate in disaster areas where access for rescuers is fraught with danger.
					Recent tests have yielded encouraging results and are also demonstrating the versatility of the drone as a platform for other technologies.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Drone technology in the health care industry might save millions of lives in the developing world since they are creative, reliable, easy-to-use and cheap. Just as drone delivery. A research published in 2016 led by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Centre suggests the same. It also adds that using drones might also improve vaccination rates.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">In some remote parts of the world, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are already being field-tested for medical uses. Drones successfully delivered small aid packages after the Haitian earthquake in 2012, and in Papua New Guinea, Doctors Without Borders used them to transport dummy TB test samples from a remote village to the large coastal city of Kerema.</p>

				<h1> Dromes and the military</h1>
				<img src="Drone Images/D4.jpg"  width="250" align="left"/>
					<p style="text-align:left;">
						Military usage of drones has become the primary use in today's world. 
						Used as target decoys, for combat missions, research and development, and for supervision, drones have been part and parcel of the military forces worldwide.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:left;">
						According to a recent reports, military spending will remain the main driver of drone spending in the coming years.
						It is estimated that global militaries will spend billions on drones by 2020, and these drones will play a vital role in the resolution of future conflicts and in the replacement of the human pilot.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align:left;">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles will continue to be applied in various military operations due to their high convenience in reducing losses and enabling the execution of high profile and time-sensitive missions.</p>
		
							<p style="text-align:left;">
								UAVs can be used for autonomous flights, this being based on pre-programmed flight plans or through the help of more complex dynamic automation systems.
								It is good to appreciate the increasing role of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in solving certain conflicts and the execution of high-profile attacks just as is the case for the present day military planners.
								They are highly convenient since you don’t have to worry about deploying people behind enemy lines since no one will be on board in case the device gets destroyed.
							</p>
						
						
							
						<p style="text-align:left;"> Drones used in the military are classified as Unmanned Aircraft Systems since these drones are usually part of systems made of:</p>
							<img src="Drone Images/D6.jpg" width="710" align="right">
							<li><mark>One or more drones destined for observation – these are equipped with a series of sensors.</mark></li>
							<li><mark>Ground control stations – these are the base of the system, controlling the drones and receiving data from sensors.</mark></li>
							<li><mark>The radio connection that is established between the drones and the ground control stations.</mark></li>

							<h2 style="text-align:left;">Positives of Utalising Drones in Government Industries</h2>
							<ul>
								<li style="text-align:left;"><b>Quality Aerial Imaging</b></li>
									<p>
										Drones can take high-quality aerial photographs and video, and collect vast amounts of imaging data. 
										These high-resolution data can be used to create 3-D maps and interactive 3-D models, which have many beneficial uses. 
										For example, 3-D mapping of disaster areas can enable rescue teams to be better prepared before entering hazardous situations.
									</p>
								<li style="text-align:left;"><b>Easily Deployable</b></li>
									<p>
										With advances in control technology, most drones can be operated by users with relatively minimal experience.
										Combined with the relative low cost of most models, this has led to drones becoming accessible to a wide range of operators.
										UAVs also have a greater range of movement than manned aircraft, being able to fly lower and in more directions, allowing them to easily navigate traditionally hard-to-access areas. 
									</p>
								<li style="text-align:left;"><b>Security</b></li>
									<p>
										 Operators can use unmanned aerial vehicles to provide security and surveillance to private companies, sporting events, public gatherings and venues.
										 Drones can also gather valuable data during and after natural disasters to aid in security and recovery efforts.
									</p>
							</ul>
							
							<h2> Negatives of Utalising Drones in Government Industries</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Safety</b></li>
									<p>
										Safety is a primary concern when dealing with unmanned aerial vehicles. 
										To avoid mid-air collisions, UAVs need to be programmed with “sense and avoid” capabilities – being able to detect a potential collision and maneuver to safety – that match those of manned aircraft pilots. 
										In the event of system failures, ground impact is another serious danger, especially when drones are used near large crowds. 
									</p>
									
								<li><b>Privacy</b></li>
									<p>
										The most common concerns from the public about UAVs is privacy.
										Drones can collect data and images without drawing attention, leading many to fear their right of privacy may be in jeopardy if government entities were to use drones to monitor the public.
